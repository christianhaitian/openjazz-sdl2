 Jazz Jackrabbit is a platform game developed and published by Epic 
 MegaGames. It was released in 1994 for PCs operating DOS, with
 subsequent Macintosh and Microsoft Windows releases in 1995 and 1996.
 It was one of the first games to bring the side-scrolling platformer
 style—common on gaming consoles—to a PC audience. On November 30,
 2017 the game was re-released on GOG.com along with Jazz Jackrabbit 2,
 with support for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
